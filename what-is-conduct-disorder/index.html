Some teens may even become defiant and hard to handle, arguing with adults and bending rules. Often it’s a phase that will pass with time and patience. With conduct disorder, it’s another story.</p><p></p><p>Zach had always been a difficult child. He didn’t get along with his classmates at school, and he frequently argued with his teachers and his parents. But by the time he turned 14, Zach was out of control. He began skipping school. His mom caught him lying to her all the time. She found electronics is his room that she had not purchased for him and since he didn’t have a job, he couldn’t have bought them. After a particularly bad argument at home, he ran away for a couple of days. Kids at school tended to avoid Zach, saying he was mean.  It was often described of Zach that he didn’t care how his actions affected others.  Nearly out of her mind with worry, Zach’s mom finally consulted a therapist. After describing her son’s increasingly rebellious and harmful behavior, the therapist suggested he might have conduct disorder.   </p><p></p><p>Conduct disorder is a predominantly childhood and adolescent disorder characterized by a persistent disregard for the rights of others or for societal norms. A person with conduct disorder may be aggressive and violent towards other people or animals. He or she may cause property loss or damage (or steal others’ property). It is not uncommon for an individual with conduct disorder to bully others and start fights.  He or she often severely violates rules.    </p><p></p><h2>Facts About Conduct Disorders</h2><ul><li data-grid-id="2548ac66-441e-4f2b-b1c3-663177c238bb" dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p>Conduct disorder affects an estimated 2-16 percent of U.S. children and teens.<b data-grid-id="7aad375b-649d-4c52-96c0-28d80d88ff02">  <br></b><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p>More boys than girls are diagnosed with conduct disorder and it usually occurs in late childhood or the early teenage years.</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p data-grid-id="02c0fc47-6d1a-49bf-a507-1412612ffba4">A child or teen with conduct disorder is at risk for developing antisocial personality disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse problems, and other mental health conditions.</p><p></p></li></ul><h2>Signs of a Conduct Disorder</h2><p></p><p>Symptoms of conduct disorder fall into four general categories:</p><ul><li data-grid-id="36749f7a-713f-496b-8b0d-78d75debbb04" dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><b data-grid-id="784d8ffd-269f-45c5-9343-529dfc2bd159">Aggressive behavior: </b>bullying, cruelty to animals or people, fighting, using weapons, or forcing someone into unwanted sexual activity.<br><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p data-grid-id="5ff09087-f190-4b53-a9e3-6b71dd47df12"><b data-grid-id="cd01abc8-21df-460d-921f-727b8dd1bf0a">Destructive behavior:</b> deliberately damaging another’s property or engaging in fire setting with the intention of damaging property.</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p data-grid-id="c9e0e765-d1dd-4d75-a924-7f4d9bef6d99"><b data-grid-id="e09ede7f-a6f7-42a4-a3e4-edcb32cf5d7e">Deceitful behavior:</b> lying, shoplifting, breaking into homes or cars with the intention to steal, or stealing from others.</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p data-grid-id="fc0f5967-8759-4cfc-acbb-b2a4f8bfb961"><b data-grid-id="bdc63782-8330-40bf-bf43-e9ae9415fcf1">Violation of rules:</b> breaking societal rules or engaging in behavior that is not age appropriate.

If you think you might be dealing with this disorder, make an appointment with a mental health professional. Usually treatment for conduct disorder often requires a combination of individual therapy, group therapy, parent training, and family therapy.  Sometimes medication is necessary to reduce symptoms well enough to enable the person to respond to the therapy. </p><p></p><p>Conduct disorder is a family problem, not just an individual problem. This means parental involvement in the treatment process is critical. Family systems therapy, parent training, and parent-child interaction therapy are cornerstones to addressing the struggles of a defiant teen. Parental engagement in their child’s treatment, their own treatment and their family’s treatment greatly increases the likelihood of healing and growth for the defiant teen.</p><p></p><h2>Common Questions and Answers About Conduct Disorder</h2><p></p><p></p><ul><li><b>What causes conduct disorder?</b> The exact causes of conduct disorder are unknown but it is likely caused by a variety of biological, social, psychological, and environmental factors. Some risk factors for developing conduct disorder include low socioeconomic status, brain damage, trauma, family history of mental illness or substance abuse, and lack of moral reasoning (such as feelings of guilt or remorse). </li></ul><p></p><ul><li data-grid-id="1012fd2e-b0dd-4f65-9687-c4d183c6a257"><b data-grid-id="4163d2a3-d5e7-4d0e-b653-a3c9f6522477">What is the outlook for people with conduct disorder?</b> Treatment outcomes vary, but people who are not treated for conduct disorder are at higher risk for developing other mental illnesses, substance abuse, suicide and problems with the law.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li><b>How is conduct disorder diagnosed?</b> A mental health professional will assess the symptoms and the individual’s history to make a proper diagnosis. In addition, it may be useful to have a medical exam to rule out a physical illness or brain injury that might be causing the behavior.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li><b>Can conduct disorder be prevented?</b> It may not be possible to prevent conduct disorder. However, recognizing the symptoms and soliciting treatment early may reduce the severity of the disorder. In addition, providing a loving home environment while maintaining discipline may also reduce symptoms and minimize destructive behavior.</li></ul><p></p><h2>References:</h2><p><a href="http://www.fulsheartransition.com/blog/teen-defiance-what-is-normal"></a></p><p><a href="http://www.fulsheartransition.com/blog/teen-defiance-what-is-normal">http://www.fulsheartransition.com/blog/teen-defiance-what-is-normal</a></p><p><a href="http://psychcentral.com/disorders/conduct-disorder-symptoms/"></a></p><p><a href="http://psychcentral.com/disorders/conduct-disorder-symptoms/">http://psychcentral.com/disorders/conduct-disorder-symptoms/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-conduct-disorder?page=3#3"></a></p><p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-conduct-disorder?page=3#3">http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-conduct-disorder?page=3#3</a></p><p><b></b></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">InnerChange</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
